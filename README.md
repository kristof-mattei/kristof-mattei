I am a passionate developer with 15 years of experience in software development, known as an expert technical problem solver, responsible for fixing many 'ghost-in-the-machine' bugs, and as a last-minute point of contact to assist colleagues in technical triages.

In my private life I'm an avid hiker and tinkerer of many things.

I also maintain [Hyper-Unix-Socket](https://github.com/kristof-mattei/hyper-unix-socket), a small extension for Hyper to allow it to connect to Unix sockets (e.g. when wanting to communicate to Docker over `/var/run/docker.sock` with Rust), and an updated fork of [manorom's reverse-proxy-service](https://github.com/manorom/reverse-proxy-service) as [Axum-Proxy](https://github.com/kristof-mattei/axum-proxy), to allow you to proxy requests coming to your Tower application.

Next to that, I rewrote some software in Rust:

- https://github.com/kristof-mattei/autoheal-rs
- https://github.com/kristof-mattei/docker-dns-rs
- https://github.com/kristof-mattei/endless-ssh-rs
- https://github.com/kristof-mattei/wsdd-rs

And I try to get as far as possible in Advent of Code:
