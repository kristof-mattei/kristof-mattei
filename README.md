I am a passionate developer with 15 years of experience in software development, known as an expert technical problem solver, responsible for fixing many 'ghost-in-the-machine' bugs, and as a last-minute point of contact to assist colleagues in technical triages.

I am expanding my knowledge into more advanced Rust ðŸ¦€.

One example is [Hyper-Unix-Socket](https://github.com/kristof-mattei/hyper-unix-socket), a small extension for Hyper to allow it to connect to Unix sockets (e.g. when wanting to communicate to Docker over `/var/run/docker.sock` with Rust).

Next to that, I rewrote some software in Rust:

-   https://github.com/kristof-mattei/magwords
-   https://github.com/kristof-mattei/docker-dns-rs
-   https://github.com/kristof-mattei/autoheal-rs
-   https://github.com/kristof-mattei/endless-ssh-rs

And I try to get as far as possible in Advent of Code:

-   https://github.com/kristof-mattei/advent-of-code-2021
-   https://github.com/kristof-mattei/advent-of-code-2022
-   https://github.com/kristof-mattei/advent-of-code-2023

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/kristofmattei), or on a hiking trail near you.

I am looking for a new adventure as a Senior / Principal Software Engineer and can be contacted on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/kristofmattei).
